Genomics data volume and velocity have increased dramatically, rendering on-premise storage insufficient and demanding specialized software tools to manage data in the cloud. [Score](https://www.overture.bio/documentation/score/) addresses this by facilitating the transfer and storage of genomics data to and from a cloud network.

Score commonly works in tandem with our metadata service, [Song](https://github.com/overture-stack/SONG). While Score handles object storage and file transfer, Song validates and tracks all the associated file metadata. 

All our core microservices are included in the Overture **Data Management System** (DMS). Built from our core collection of microservices, the DMS offers turnkey installation, configuration, and deployment of Overture software. For more information on the DMS, read our [DMS documentation](https://www.overture.bio/documentation/dms/).
