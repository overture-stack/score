### Creating a Pull Request

- Provide a clear title and detailed description
- Reference related issues
- Include screenshots or GIFs for UI changes
- Assign reviewers and add appropriate labels

### Using Draft Pull Requests

Draft Pull Requests are an excellent way to document work in progress and facilitate early feedback. Use them to:

- Organize your thoughts and process
- Share early work and ideas with the team
- Get feedback on implementation approaches before finalizing code
- Track progress on long-running features

Guidelines for Draft Pull Requests:

1. **Creation**:
   - Open a pull request and select "Create draft pull request"
   - Clearly mark the title with [WIP] or [DRAFT] prefix
2. **Description**:
   - Outline the current state of the work
   - List planned tasks or improvements
   - Highlight areas where feedback is specifically needed
3. **Updates**:
   - Regularly update the description or provide comments following commits with progress notes
   - Use task lists (- [ ]) to track completion of sub-tasks
4. **Collaboration**:
   - Encourage early feedback and discussion
   - Use the pull request comments for design discussions
5. **Finalization**:
   - Complete all planned work and address feedback
   - Update tests and documentation
   - Click "Ready for review" to move out of draft state

### Merging a Pull Request

- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Obtain the required number of approvals
- Use the project's specified merge strategy (Typically squash and merge)
- Delete the source branch after merging if no longer needed
