What is Score?
======================

`Score <https://www.overture.bio/products/score>`_ facilitates the transfer and storage of your data seamlessly for cloud-based projects. File bundling, resumable downloads, and BAM/CRAM slicing make data transfer fast and smooth.

The method with which Score facilitates the transfer of data is through the use of pre-signed URLs. As such, Score can be thought of as a broker between an object storage system and user authorization system, validating user access and generating signed URLs for object access.
